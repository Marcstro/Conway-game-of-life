# Conway-game-of-life
My Java Swing version of Conway-game-of-life.

IMPORTANT:
I was given 4 hours to complete this game/simulation. I originally did NOT expect to finish it in time. 
I continued to document how I progressed through this quite stressful assignment in the file "ProjectProgressionDocumentation.MD".
In the end, the final version is slightly buggy and NOT prettily written. But I'm quite proud of having written the whole program in such a short time.
